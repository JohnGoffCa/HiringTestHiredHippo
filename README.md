# Charlie and the Chocolate Kingdom

Welcome to Charlie's Chocolate Kingdom! This is a SPA page for a contest entry page. It was built with Angular 2, with an optional backend written in Go.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.5.

## Instructions
install dependencies with `npm install`. Then run development server or Go server to access app.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Go Backend 

If you wish to use the Go server, run `./build-and-serve.sh`, which will compile the Angular SPA, the Go server, and serve the project on `localhost:8080`
